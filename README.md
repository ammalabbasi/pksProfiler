# pksProfiler

[![License: BSD 2-Clause](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-BSD_2--Clause-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

**pksProfiler** is a Nextflow pipeline for detecting, quantifying, and visualizing the *pks* (polyketide synthase) pathogenicity island in BAM, CRAM, single-end FASTQ, or paired-end FASTQ data. It reports counts for each of the 19 *clbA–clbS* genes and can optionally identify species supported by *pks*-aligned reads and summarize their *clb* gene support.

## How it works

<img src="workflow_logo/v1.png" width="800" alt="pksProfiler workflow">

The workflow has five modules:

1. **Read preparation** extracts primary unmapped reads from BAM or CRAM input, or accepts single/paired FASTQ input, then filters the reads with fastp.
2. **Host depletion** removes reads matching the supplied GRCh38 and T2T/phiX Minimap2 indexes.
3. **pks profiling** quantifies the island with Bowtie2 alignment by default. DNA HMM profiling can be selected instead or run alongside alignment.
4. **Summarization** produces 19-gene count matrices and a circular island-coverage plot for samples with aligned *pks* reads.
5. **Optional taxonomy** runs KrakenUniq and Bracken on *pks*-aligned reads and reports species-by-*clb*-gene support.

Alignment and HMM profiling are complementary and are not expected to produce identical counts. Alignment provides stringent reference-based evidence; HMM profiling can recover more divergent or fragmented matches.

## Installation

### 1. Install the requirements

- Linux
- [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/install.html) 24.10 or newer
- Java 17 or newer
- Conda or Mamba
- Git

### 2. Clone pksProfiler

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlexandrovLab/pksProfiler.git
cd pksProfiler

nextflow -version
nextflow lint main.nf
```

### 3. Download the host-depletion indexes

Download these two files from the [pksProfiler reference-index folder on Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HounCjQE8pyve8hGBvhUVkvWHrWbpO35?usp=share_link):

- `human-GRC-db.mmi`
- `human-GCA-phix-db.mmi`

Place them together in a permanent directory that is readable from every compute node. For example:

```text
/references/pksProfiler/
├── human-GRC-db.mmi
└── human-GCA-phix-db.mmi
```

The *pks*-positive *E. coli* Bowtie2 index, *clbA–clbS* annotation, and DNA HMM database are already included in this repository.

The workflow performs two host-depletion passes by default: first against `--hg38_db`, then against `--t2t_phix_db`. To enable an optional third pass against human-pangenome Minimap2 indexes, supply `--pangenome_db /path/to/pangenome_mmi`. The supplied `.mmi` files are external binary indexes, so retain the source FASTA/build manifest with any locally rebuilt or substituted indexes; the parameter names alone do not verify index contents.

### 4. Optional: install the taxonomy database

This step is needed only when running the [taxonomy mode](docs/running/taxonomy.md). The pipeline was validated with the 8 August 2023 KrakenUniq Microbial database.

```bash
mkdir -p /references/krakenuniq_2023
cd /references/krakenuniq_2023

wget https://genome-idx.s3.amazonaws.com/kraken/uniq/krakendb-2023-08-08-MICROBIAL/database.kdb
wget https://genome-idx.s3.amazonaws.com/kraken/uniq/krakendb-2023-08-08-MICROBIAL/kuniq_microbialdb_minus_kdb.20230808.tgz
tar -xzf kuniq_microbialdb_minus_kdb.20230808.tgz
```

This database is very large: `database.kdb` alone is approximately 535 GB. Download both files into the same directory. Additional databases are available under **KrakenUniq** on the [AWS Kraken 2 indexes page](https://benlangmead.github.io/aws-indexes/k2).

## Running pksProfiler

### Quick start

Create an alignment sample sheet named `samples.csv`:

```csv
patient,alignment
sample1,/absolute/path/to/sample1.bam
```

Run the default alignment workflow:

```bash
nextflow run main.nf \
    -profile conda \
    --sample samples.csv \
    --input_data_type auto \
    --hg38_db /references/pksProfiler/human-GRC-db.mmi \
    --t2t_phix_db /references/pksProfiler/human-GCA-phix-db.mmi \
    --outdir results
```

Bowtie2 alignment is the default, so `--profiling_method bowtie2` does not need to be written.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Values/default | Required | Description |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `--sample` | CSV path | Yes | Alignment or FASTQ sample sheet |
| `--input_data_type` | `auto` (default), `bam`, `cram`, `fastq` | No | Selects or checks the input format |
| `--cram_reference` | FASTA path | No | Matching CRAM reference; optional when embedded or available through HTSlib reference lookup |
| `--profiling_method` | `bowtie2` (default), `hmm`, `both` | No | Profiling method(s) to run |
| `--hg38_db` | `.mmi` path | Yes | GRCh38 Minimap2 index |
| `--t2t_phix_db` | `.mmi` path | Yes | T2T/phiX Minimap2 index |
| `--pangenome_db` | not set | No | Optional combined `.mmi` index or directory of `.mmi` indexes; supplying it enables pangenome depletion |
| `--outdir` | `results` | No | Output directory |
| `--save_intermediates` | `false` | No | Publish extracted, filtered, and host-depleted FASTQs under the output directory |
| `--hmm_evalue` | `1e-10` | No | Positive HMM E-value threshold |
| `--hmm_chunking` | `false` | No | Parallelize HMM scanning across chunks |
| `--pks_taxa` | off | No | Enable taxonomy by including this flag |
| `--kraken_db` | directory | With taxonomy | KrakenUniq/Bracken database directory |
| `--bracken_read_length` | positive integer | With taxonomy | Read length supported by the Bracken database |

Alignment input should use `patient,alignment`; the legacy `patient,bam` form remains supported for existing sample sheets. The `alignment` column accepts BAM or CRAM. Use `--input_data_type auto` to detect either format from file content, or `bam`/`cram` to require one format. When a CRAM cannot obtain its reference from embedded data, `REF_CACHE`, `REF_PATH`, or its local header URI, supply the matching FASTA with `--cram_reference`. FASTQ mode requires `patient,fastq1`; add `fastq2` for paired reads. The `fastq2` column may be absent or empty for a single-FASTQ sample. Sample identifiers must be unique and may contain letters, numbers, periods, underscores, and hyphens; the first character must be alphanumeric. File paths should be absolute when running on a cluster.

Intermediate FASTQs remain in the Nextflow work directory for resumability but are not copied into the results directory by default. Add `--save_intermediates true` only when those files are needed for inspection or reuse.

Read filtering avoids a merged intermediate FASTQ: single streams are passed directly to fastp, while paired FASTQs are combined through standard input after mate identifiers are preserved. QC read counts come from fastp's JSON report rather than additional full FASTQ decompression passes. The default filter allocation remains four CPUs with compression level 4 to balance per-sample latency, cohort concurrency, and temporary-file size.

To include the optional pangenome depletion stage, add these arguments to any run command:

```bash
--pangenome_db /references/pksProfiler/pangenome_mmi
```

`--pangenome_db` may point either to one combined Minimap2 `.mmi` index or to a directory containing separate `.mmi` indexes. When a directory is supplied, the pipeline sorts the index paths and depletes against each one sequentially. A combined index is generally faster because Minimap2 is launched only once.

## Example results

The repository includes small positive and negative output examples:

| Sample | Alignment counts | HMM counts |
|---|---|---|
| Synthetic positive | [view table](examples/results/synthetic_positive/pks.gene.counts.align.txt) | [view table](examples/results/synthetic_positive/pks.gene.counts.hmm.txt) |
| Synthetic negative | [view table](examples/results/synthetic_negative/pks.gene.counts.align.txt) | [view table](examples/results/synthetic_negative/pks.gene.counts.hmm.txt) |

Each table contains one row for every gene from `clbA` through `clbS`. A valid negative sample remains in the matrix with zero counts.

```text
Gene    synthetic_pks_positive
clbA    1
clbB    38
clbC    10
...     ...
clbS    2
```

`pks_summary/qc/pks.qc.summary.tsv` contains one row per sample and records attrition through extraction, fastp, and the host-depletion passes. For BAM/CRAM input, `input_reads` and `unmapped_reads` both report the extracted primary-unmapped read count; the complete alignment is intentionally not scanned a second time solely to count all records. When `--pangenome_db` is supplied, the summary also reports `reads_after_pangenome`; otherwise that column is `NA`. Alignment runs report `num_clb_genes_align` and `reads_clb_genes_align`. HMM runs report `num_clb_genes_hmm` and `reads_clb_genes_hmm` after applying `--hmm_evalue` and best-hit assignment. Method-specific fields are reported as `NA` when that method is not selected. When `--save_intermediates true` is used, `unmapped_reads/` and `host_depleted_reads/` are also published.

For BAM input, `input_reads` is the number of primary alignment records in the supplied BAM and `unmapped_reads` is the subset extracted for profiling. For paired FASTQ input, `input_reads` is the combined number of R1 and R2 records and `unmapped_reads` has the same value because the supplied FASTQs enter FASTP directly. All subsequent columns count individual reads, not read pairs.
